FTDI have provided a managed .NET wrapper class for the FTD2XX DLL on the Windows platform.  The managed wrapper DLL (FTD2XX_NET.DLL) is provided as a free download with Intellisense documentation provided in the FTD2XX_NET.XML file â€“ this is viewable in the Visual Studio Object Browser and also provides hints as the code is written.

# NOTE
I did not create this code nor am I affiliated with FTDI. I downloaded the original code from FTDI and recompiled it and packaged for nuget for the following frameworks:
- .Net Standard 2.0
- .Net Standard 2.1
- .Net Framework 4.5

The original code can be found on the [FTDI website](https://ftdichip.com/software-examples/code-examples/csharp-examples/).
